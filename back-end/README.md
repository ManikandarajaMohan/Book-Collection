# Node JS Application 

This project was generated with [Node Js with Express]. At the time of developement I used node version v14.15.3

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, npm, installed in your environement.

This application is resposible for supporting creating, deleting, viewing and updating of collection of books.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` to start your server on local. The application will listen in port number http://localhost:3001.

Since there is not DB connection setup and for time being I have used a json file in the name of db.json to store and retriew the records.

## Documentation

Swagger-UI-Express has been used for documention. After running the development server you can able to access the swagger-ui using the url http://localhost:3001/api-docs
